### Hi there 👋

I'm **Paula Nogueira Guedes**.
I'm a full stack developer.

Currently I work with **Angular** and **Microsoft Dynamics 360**, and I have previous experience with **.NET**,**Ruby on Rails** and **PostgreSQL**. 
I love studying, so I learned **React**, **React Native**, **Node.Js**, **Android Studio**, **MySQL** and **Docker**.
On my personal projects and studies, I also used **MySQL**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **HTML** and **CSS** .

I’m currently working at **Itaú Unibanco**, as a Software Engineer.

I love learning new things, meeting interesting people and I surely love what I do! 🎉️
